## Breeze Overview üåç
Breeze is an application that can help users track and calculate the carbon footprint generated by the food they eat and the vehicles they use, as well as educate Gen-Z with gamification methods to encourage users to be educated and care more about the environment through available events.  By utilizing a gamification approach, Breeze not only measures carbon footprints, but also encourages users to engage in environmental activities. Gen-Z can increase their level by reducing carbon emissions through the tracker app, earning points, and supporting environmental initiatives such as tree planting. These points can be redeemed for various rewards, encouraging active participation. BREEZE is not just an app, but also a movement to support the Indonesian government's emission reduction target by 2030.
